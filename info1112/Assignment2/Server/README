Hello! This is a light version RoverNet

I have included a run.sh file to immediately get started with running the server, it will publish the port and ip (which will be localhost) that you can connect to.

This will allow you to test all the features within the Mars Rover assignment locally.

To simply get started, just execute the follow:

bash run.sh &

This will reset the database and start the server. You can connect to the local server with your client.

Have fun!
